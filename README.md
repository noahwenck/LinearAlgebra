# Linear Algebra in SpringBoot
This is a learning excercise for me to further my understanding of SpringBoot and Linear Algebra.

There is not much right now, but I will update this README in the future
once I've gotten a good start and have something tangible
(instead of just being able to test code using unit tests).

### todo
1. Develop Frontend (Function over beauty)
2. Implement Row Reduction after matrix setup
3. Configure Gradle
4. PMD? cant believe I actually put that on a todo list to add to this
5. Row reduction is the focus, but consider other topics 
(bases, transforms, independence, orthogonality, eigenvectors/values?)
